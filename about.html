  <h2>Who’s This Curious Human? 👀</h2>
  <p>
    Okay, those lines above were already super fun — but hey, this part’s going to get even better! 😉  
    So, here’s a little peek into my world the story behind the smile and the spark!
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m <strong>Aishwarya</strong>  a cheerful, curious human who finds joy in the tiniest things.  
    I grew up in a cozy town filled with laughter, rain, and people who never let you go hungry 🌦️🍛.  
    My school days? Full of memories, mischief, and way too many notebooks with doodles in the margins!
  </p>

  <p>
    Fun fact: in 10th grade, my absolute favorite thing ever was the <strong>Hibiscus flower diagram</strong> 🌺.  
    I could draw it like a pro those petals, stamens, and all! That’s where my love for biology truly bloomed.  
    I was *the* biology girl  always curious about how living things worked.
  </p>

  <p>
  After 10th, I had my heart set on becoming a <strong>doctor</strong> 🩺  biology was my world, and I genuinely loved it!  
  But life had other plans 😅. When it came time to choose my stream, I went with <strong>PCMCS</strong> (Physics, Chemistry, Math, and Computer Science).  
  That’s where things took a turn — I slowly found myself enjoying coding more than chemical equations! 💻  
  What started as curiosity soon became passion — I realized I loved the way computers think, and how logic could create something real.  
  So yeah, I guess I traded the stethoscope for a keyboard... and honestly, no regrets at all 😎✨.
</p>

  <p>
    Now, I’m happily living the techie life — exploring AI, experimenting with code,  
    and occasionally yelling “why won’t this run?!” at my laptop (in a very loving way, of course 😂).
  </p>

  <p>
    Outside the tech bubble, I’m all about music, journaling random thoughts,  
    and finding joy in the simplest moments 🎧📖✨.  
    And yes — I can communicate in <strong>five languages!</strong> Not perfectly fluent in all,  
    but enough to make friends, order food, and survive anywhere on Earth 🌍😄.
  </p>

  <p>
    So yep — that’s me! A curious blend of biology roots, tech dreams, and a whole lot of heart 💕.  
    Thanks for sticking around to read — hope you smiled at least once!
